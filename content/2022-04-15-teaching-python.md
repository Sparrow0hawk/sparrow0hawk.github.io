The reference to mastery in this blog title is mostly ironic, as I would readily admit I am definitely not a master of Python and indeed very far from it!
That said, I certainly aspire to this sort of intangible concept of mastery. 

<!-- more -->

This idea comes from a place of seeing software development/engineering as modern day craft, and the historical career progression of craftsmen in the European guild system from apprentice, to journeyman and finally to being a master[^1]. 

As someone who didn't start off their software engineering career through any formal training, I find this way of thinking about my skill progression both helpful and unhelpful.
Having no qualifications that confirm I've been tested to a standard as a software engineer, I think of myself as a journeyman. Having broken through the apprentice phase of learning, I'm now confident writing Python and understand the basics.
However, being a journeyman is a rather large grey area. I can definitely do stuff but I wouldn't consider myself an expert, and I'm hungry to learn more and expand my Python skills. 
That's not to say being a master or expert is a static position where you've learned everything, but perhaps those labels are merely aspirational.
Or indeed as a wiser colleague than me once remarked _"someday you'll find that the next wisest person from you leaves and suddenly everyone is asking you for advice"_. 

So, on this rather unclear trajectory towards mastery comes what I would say are the tremendous benefits of sitting down and teaching a topic.
Teaching is actually a rather large part of my role as a research software engineer, whether that be one-to-one advice to students, or larger more formal workshops we run.
When I first took Python workshops I was quite apprehensive, as teaching felt like a real test of my own knowledge. 
Thankfully, our courses are based on the great resources from [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and have been honed many times by very experienced educators.

Now, I really enjoy teaching Python. 
I find it a unique opportunity to have to unwind everything I know that I've learned through my weird and winding journey and share it with others.
Sometimes I don't know stuff, or find a concept hard to explain, and will have to go off and recover something I thought I knew.
This only ever helps me learn (or relearn) crucial things I thought I knew.
I like to think that act of teaching is actually helping make me a better Pythonista because every student comes with a different perspective forcing you to clarify your own understanding of concepts.

So on your path to /mastery/ take the opportunity to teach if you can, it's scary but fun and will make you better!
