I currently work as a Research Software Engineer in the [Research Computing team](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/) at the University of Leeds. We help provide training to researchers on reproducible research, using the University's High performance computing system and help foster a collaborative computational research community.

From 2014 to 2018 I worked on understanding how [Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus remodelled the nuclear pore complex](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/23015/1/Coleman_AJ_SMCB_PhD_2018.pdf) within human cells under the supervision of Professor Adrian Whitehouse. 
Doing a PhD was a fantastic, almighty challenge but in the end laboratory science wasn't for me.

I'd started to play with scripting using R and Python and got the bug to code so went on to do a Data Science Internship with Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.
There I was able to put into practice data science ideas and became interest in how you build usable data science tools.
This led me into software engineering and how to apply software engineering ideas to research software and thus research software engineering!
