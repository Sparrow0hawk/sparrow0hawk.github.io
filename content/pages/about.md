Title: About

I currently work in the public sector as a software developer.

Prior to that I was a Research Software Engineer in the [Research Computing team](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/) at the University of Leeds. 

From 2014 to 2018 I worked on understanding how [Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus remodelled the nuclear pore complex](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/23015/1/Coleman_AJ_SMCB_PhD_2018.pdf) 
within human cells under the supervision of Professor Adrian Whitehouse.
