Title: Six Dales Trail 50k race report
Date: 2025-08-16

This post is more of a reflection that a day-after race report, but with the benefit of a month or so since the race I'm
still very pleased with how it all went and to have finished my first 50k.

Since moving up to Otley I've spent a reasonable amount of time along the Six dales trail. I've found the sections I love,
like the path along the River Washburn from Blubberhouses up to Thruscross Dam and the stretch down past Dob park farm. 
I also knew the stretches I liked less, running around Swinsty and Fewston reservoirs and the climb back up from Padside
green. In all my recce-ing I still hadn't quite run the entirety of the route but the majority of the race journey would 
be familiar to me and I could ride the highs with the lows and enjoy what is a wonderful trail. 

When engaging in any sporting endeavour I always want to do well, and as someone who fenced competitively for a long part 
of my youth I've always defined success by your final position. When I started doing some road races again I defined my
success around my time and trying to go faster. I still find it hard to shake that mentality but have come to accept through
working with a coach and doing races like Eryri that success can be many things. I can't deny thinking about where I'd like
to finish in this race but I knew that my primary goal was just to finish. I also tried to be intentional about viewing 
this race not as a competition against others but a race against the course and crucially myself.

My biggest concern heading into the race was the day being hot. I had enjoyed plenty of long runs along the route but found
that on hot, sunny days I really struggled. Thankfully, the day of the race was cloudy and cool so my fears regarding 
temperature didn't materialise. We started off nice and early and in my usual fashion I started a little bit too quick,
the route quickly starts to climb through Newall and cuts a 7% climb through cow fields to Clifton. I've spent quite a 
bit of time running this section, which starts on pretty runnable cow fields, up a steepish climb through a tunnel of trees
before giving way to a farm track up to Clifton village itself. I was probably a bit keen here and ran sections I should
have walked, given there was about 45k to go, conserving energy early would have been a better idea. Just as I reached Clifton
village the farmer was preparing to move his cows from the sheds down to the fields, which we'd been warned may happen by the race director.
I was just ahead of the cows so managed to not get stuck but a significant number of runners were halted whilst this went on. 
Out of Clifton the next section crosses the road and over a bump of a sheep field, before crossing a small brook and 
following the fenceline of more fields. After a turn, a gentle climb and a sharp downhill you're at Crag farm. From
here you pass through various gates climbing back up to a track on the top of the hill amongst the sheep and cows. You get a
great view out across to Lindley and the woods by the reservoir before teeing back up to the road which is a zooming descent
past Dob park farm until you reach the old bridge. I got myself into a comfortable pace for this section, remembering to 
eat and drink, pushing it a bit on the Dob park descent and finally reaching a section I enjoy that leads to the reservoirs.
Along this stretch I was able to provide some navigation advice as a few people got turned around, this isn't surprising as
there's a meeting of footpaths in Ellers wood that has had me turned around a few times. Further on there's a steep hill climb
so into hike mode and gate hopping past Nether Timble farm (repairs still ongoing). I get to the Swinsty and Fewston reservoirs
and yeah, don't really enjoy it but know at Blubberhouses the first checkpoint will offer some respite. At the aid station
I top up my water and start a packet of hula-hoops (my salty treat) and get to enjoy the next stretch along the Washburn 
to the Thruscross dam. 

I climb up to the top of the dam and there's a few people waiting for racers, I get some high-fives because I know there's a
really niggly road climb approaching and things are getting a bit tired. Down over lumpy bumpy fields past Padside green
and more lumpy bumpy fields to the turnaround check point. Something about this terrain really takes it out of me and I 
mix running with some walking. At the aid station I make up a new SuperCarbs flask and eat some orange and melon and when
I'm ready head back out. I'm definitely tired by this stage and whilst it's not a full-blown bonk I slow things down,
run-walk back through the fields, particularly because I know there's the climb back up to the water tower near Thruscross
which is not my favourite. As I come down the road to the dam I really start to feel it and have to drop to a walk, bonk-time,
I try and just reset, eat something, walk a bit, enjoy the scenery. Once I come down from the dam I'm on one of my preferred
stretches and try and run-walk, knowing the aid station at Blubberhouses is close. I top up my water at the aid station 
and crack on with the slog back round Swinsty and Fewston, this really is a slog and lots of run-walking. My stomach feels
bloated and I'm struggling to really eat a lot. I focus on walking it off, knowing that this sensation will pass and soon
I'll be off the reservoir paths and back on the nicer trails. My energy and rhythm doesn't really come back for a long stretch
until near Dob park bridge when I spot some runners from the 25K race making their way back.
Seeing them still going gives me a boost and I trot along briefly with them before starting the long climb back up Dob park 
road. At 42km in this was always going to be a hike but things were feeling a lot better at this point and I was comfortably
able to climb and once at the top get back into a light run. 

As the route diverged again from the road I reach the final aid station. I get a refill of water and try some orange squash
as I'm out of my liquid calories. I find the orange squash is **STRONG** as I set out and I'm not going to have a lot
of it. But this final 7/8km is a stretch I know well, steady down to Crag farm, short sharp uphill past the small wood but 
once at the top the view opens out and looks back across the Wharfe valley and you can see home. Once I hit Clifton my
energy is coming back and I start to feel comfortable running. There are stages where I feel like I'm flying down and 
once in Newall I catch back up with another runner. We stick together for the final kilometre or so and I say that I'm not
interested in a sprint finish. We cross the temporary footbridge over the Wharfe and cruise to the finish on Cattle Market
street. I feel remarkable good at the finish and joke that I maybe could have gone on a bit longer, but a friend makes me
a cup of tea which tastes absolutely delicious and I'm happy to call that a day.
