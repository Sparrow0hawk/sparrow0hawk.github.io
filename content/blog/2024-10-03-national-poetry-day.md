Title: Happy National Poetry Day

Running in the sunshine, running in the frost  
Running on your favourite route, run to get lost.

Running in the summer, running in the rain  
Running for the high, but not through the pain.

Running through the wilderness, running by the road  
Running to your lover, running from your foes.

Born to run, hate to run  
Got to run sometimes.

Runnings just a human thing that helps us all get by.
